# CodeWorkers
A universal parsing tool &amp; a source code generator

A clone project from [http://codeworker.free.fr/]().


**CodeWorker** is a versatile Open Source (GNU Lesser General Public License) parsing tool and a source code generator devoted to generative programming. Generative programming is a software engineering approach interested in automating the production of reusable, tailor-made, adaptable and reliable IT systems. 

*In layman's terms, CodeWorker lets you generate code by parsing existing languages, or by creating and parsing your own language. Once a language file has been parsed, CodeWorker provides several techniques for generating code.*   

The tool's scripting language drives the parsing and source code generation process. The scripting language syntax is derived from the C family of languages, making it familiar to most programmers. The template syntax is like JSP, ASP, or Velocity.   

It has variations for parsing, code generation, or procedural programming, giving the developer a number of options for organizing CodeWorker projects.
